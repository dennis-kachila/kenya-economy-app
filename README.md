# Kenya Economy Analysis App

The **Kenya Economy Analysis App** is a React-based web application designed to provide a simple visualization of Kenya's economic indicators. The app is itended to fetches real-time and historical data from various sources and presents it in an interactive and user-friendly interface (to be implemented later). It allows users to explore trends, compare metrics, and gain insights into Kenya's economic performance.

- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** Analyze Kenya's GDP growth over the years.
- **National Debt:** Track the country's debt as a percentage of GDP.
- **Trade Balance:** Explore the difference between Kenya's exports and imports.
- **Inflation Rate:** View the inflation trends and their impact on purchasing power.
- **Unemployment Rate:** Examine the unemployment rate trends in Kenya.


## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Recharts:** For creating interactive and customizable charts.
- **Framer Motion:** For smooth animations and transitions.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
- **Lucide Icons:** For visually appealing icons.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
