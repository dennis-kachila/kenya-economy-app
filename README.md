# Kenya Economy Analysis App

The **Kenya Economy Analysis App** is a React-based web application designed to provide a comprehensive visualization of Kenya's economic indicators. The app fetches real-time and historical data from various sources and presents it in an interactive and user-friendly interface. It allows users to explore trends, compare metrics, and gain insights into Kenya's economic performance.

- **Inflation Rate:** View the inflation trends and their impact on purchasing power.
- **Unemployment Rate:** Examine the unemployment rate trends in Kenya.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Interactive Charts:**
   - Line, Area, and Bar charts for visualizing data.
   - Tooltips for detailed data points.
   - Legends for easy identification of metrics.

2. **Data Controls:**
   - Filter data by specific years or date ranges.
   - Toggle between different chart types (Line, Area, Bar).

3. **Real-Time Data:**
   - Fetches data from live APIs for up-to-date economic insights.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

5. **Skeleton Loading States:**
   - Displays loading placeholders while data is being fetched.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Recharts:** For creating interactive and customizable charts.
- **Framer Motion:** For smooth animations and transitions.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
- **Lucide Icons:** For visually appealing icons.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
